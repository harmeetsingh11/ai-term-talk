## Project Context

This project is the first task of the **Tublian AI Internship**. Through this challenge, I got to learn how to build applications on top of `Large Language Models`. Specifically, gain hands-on experience using cloud-based AI services and `LLaMa3`, the most popular `open-source LLM`.

WELCOME TO AI-TERM-TALK (CLI AI CHATBOT)!
Ask your question (or type 'exit' to quit): what is machine learning? (explain in one line)
Thinking...
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed, allowing them to recognize patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time.    

Ask another question (or type 'exit' to quit): exit

GOODBYE!
